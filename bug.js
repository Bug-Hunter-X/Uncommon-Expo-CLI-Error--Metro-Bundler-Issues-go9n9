This error occurs when using Expo's `start` command and is related to the Metro bundler, the JavaScript module bundler used by React Native and Expo.  It's often triggered by issues with package dependencies, incorrect configurations in `package.json` or `metro.config.js`, or problems with the project's file system.  The error message itself is often cryptic and may not pinpoint the exact source.

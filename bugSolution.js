The solution often involves a multi-step process:

1. **Clean the cache:** Run `expo start --clear` to clear the Metro bundler cache. This often resolves temporary issues.
2. **Check package.json:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and versions are compatible.  Resolve any warnings or errors during `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. **Inspect metro.config.js:** If you have a `metro.config.js` file, examine it carefully for any misconfigurations or conflicting settings.  Ensure that all paths and configurations are correct.
4. **Check for circular dependencies:** Use a tool or your IDE to search for and resolve circular dependencies in your code, which can cause issues with the bundler.
5. **Resolve dependency conflicts:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate potential conflicting dependencies and address them using techniques such as version pinning or using a different dependency.
6. **Restart your system:**  In rare cases, a system restart can resolve issues that might be blocking the bundler.
7. **Verify file system permissions:** Ensure your project directory and related files have correct read/write permissions.
8. **Check for corrupted files:** If other steps fail, consider temporarily renaming or deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies.
